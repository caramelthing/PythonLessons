# PythonLessons
my practicals as I learn the language

Even this is a leasson.
Read me file apparently best practice

So this repo will have many small bits of code where i take learning modules from youtube and my book and build them practically.
just an example to use git really.

Book: Automate the boring stuff with Python.

EVentually though little projects and at any stage i cannot progress I'll flick over more learnings here where i am stuff.
