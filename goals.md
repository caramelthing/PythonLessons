# PythonLessons
my practicals as I learn the language

This repo will have many small simple but fundamental bit of code where I'm logging what I absorb from modules on youtube and THE book and build them practically.
just an excuse to use git really.

Book: Automate the boring stuff with Python.

Eventually though little projects and at any stage I cannot progress I'll push over more learnings here where i am sat
